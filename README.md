## What is a Chatbot?

A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, particularly over the internet. It acts as a virtual assistant that communicates with users through text messages, aiding businesses in connecting with their customers. Chatbots are developed to imitate human communication via chat interfaces or voice calls. They are intended to provide seamless interactions, often blurring the line between human and machine communication.

### Goals Achieved by Chatbots:
- Increasing operational efficiency
- Automating customer request fulfillment
- Handling basic queries to free employees for complex inquiries
- Providing multi-language support
- Saving time and effort by automating customer support
- Improving response rates and customer engagement
- Personalizing communication

## How does a Chatbot Work?

Chatbots are software applications equipped with an application layer, a database, and APIs. They employ pattern matching to classify text and generate suitable responses to user queries. There are mainly three types of chatbots:

### Types of Chatbots:
- **Rule-Based Chatbot:** Allows user interaction through predefined options.
- **Independent (Keyword) Chatbots:** Utilize machine learning and keywords to respond effectively.
- **NLP (Contextual) Chatbots:** Most advanced bots using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand context and intent.

## Chatbot Platforms Comparison (2020)

Several platforms offer AI chatbot building capabilities. Here are some notable platforms from 2020:

- **Azure Bot Service:** Allows building, testing, and deploying chatbots from scratch using open-source SDK and tools.
- **Botsify:** Empowers non-technical users to create chatbots using an intuitive interface and export user responses to a CSV.
- **Amazon Lex:** Enables building conversational interfaces using text and voice, with advanced deep learning functionalities.
- **Mobile Monkey:** Specializes in marketing chatbots for Facebook ads, SMS, and web chat, offering ready-made templates.

## Building a Chatbot in Python using Chatterbot

Chatterbot is a Python library specifically designed for generating chatbots. It uses machine learning algorithms to fabricate responses based on user requests. The library improves responses' accuracy as it accumulates more user interactions.

### Chatterbot Features:
- Generates responses based on machine learning algorithms.
- Develops chatbots that can engage in conversations.
- Uses user statements to train and improve responses.
- Enables customization of datasets and structures.

### Installation:
```bash
pip install chatterbot
pip install chatterbot_corpus
